## Assgignment
`Description`

The product Tweeter (or zTwitSplit) allows users to post short messages limited to 50 characters each.
Sometimes, users get excited and write messages longer than 50 characters.
Instead of rejecting these messages, we would like to add a new feature that will split the message into parts and send multiple messages on the user's behalf, all of them meeting the 50 character requirement.

`Example`

Suppose the user wants to send the following message:
"I can't believe Tweeter now supports chunking my messages, so I don't have to do it myself."
This is 91 characters excluding the surrounding quotes. When the user presses send, it will send the following messages:
"1/2 I can't believe Tweeter now supports chunking" "2/2 my messages, so I don't have to do it myself."
Each message is now 49 characters, each within the allowed limit.
